## NEXT ##

* think about a logic in task that puts #DATE and #REVISIT tags into #TIMESTAMP as long as there is no #TIMESTAMP
=> #REVISIT takes precedence over #DATE
=> drop REVISIT field

* what about this: http://www.historische-kommission-muenchen-editionen.de/beacon_adr.txt?
=> import task should check: if no alternative target but only a-zA-Z, append this to annotation field and nevertheless create target
=> use isValidURL for alternativeTarget

## IDEAS / POSSIBLE FEATURES ##

* Scheduler task
** before GeneralUtility::getURL do a HEADER comparison as suggested in specification
** introduce logging verbosity level 1 - 3 (per scheduler task)

* SeeAlso plugin
** calling the lookUp action with a gnd and format json could also return results (in seeAlso json)

* Generator plugin
** RDF output for generator plugin (Turtle?);

Setup
-----

All features of the Beaconizer can be used independently. For example, there is
no obligation to harvest links from BEACON files. You can use the *SeeAlso plugin* just
in standalone mode together with the webservice at *beacon.findbuch.de*.
The BEACON generator also can be used standalone.

The only thing that you should create are some BEACON provider records. Please read
the according section below on how to do that.

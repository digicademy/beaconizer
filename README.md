# beaconizer

With the TYPO3 Beaconizer you can harvest links based on authority files (BEACON files), enrich your detail views with context related links ("see also" links) and open your data to external applications and webservices via dynamically generated BEACON files.

BEACON is a simple file format to exchange hyperlinks. A BEACON file contains a 1-to-1 (or 1-to-n) mapping from identifiers to links. Each link consists of at least an URL with an optional annotation (you can read more about the format and it's purposes in [Wikipedia](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_links_to_external_resources)).

This is the development repository for the Beaconizer. You can find all official extension releases is the TYPO3 Extension Repository at http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/beaconizer.
